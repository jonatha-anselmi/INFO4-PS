## Rejection Method

1. Use the Rejection Method to generate $n=10^5$ samples for the a random variable $X$ that has the pdf of $f_X(t)=\frac{t^2}{9}$, $0<t<3$.
2. Estimate $P(X< 2)$ and compare your result with its exact value, i.e., $\frac{8}{27}$.
3. Compute the average number of iterations of the rejection method to generate one sample
4. Create a density histogram for your generated values and compare it with the theoretical density $f_X(t)$.

### Hints
 - use the `runif` command to sample from a uniform distribution
 - use the `hist` command to create an histogram and `curve` to plot $f_X(t)$

```{r setup, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
n=1e5;
accept = c(); # Create an empty vector. This vector will contain the samples of X
iter_vec = c(); # This vector will contain the number of iterations per sample

k=3;
for (count in 1:n){
  # Rejection method here
  j=0;
  while(TRUE){
    #Generate Ui and Yi
    j=j+1;
    Ui=runif(1,0,1);
    Yi=runif(1,0,3);
    # if k*q(Yi)*Ui<=p(Yi), or equivalently if we fall under the curve of density f_X,
    # then accept Yi
    if( k*Ui/3 <= Yi^2/9 ) {
      accept[count]=Yi;
      iter_vec[count]=j;
      break;
    }
  }  
}

p_le2_rm=sum(accept<2)/n;
p_le2_theory=8/27;
print(paste0("The rejection method says P(X<2) = ", p_le2_rm ));
print(paste0("  ... while theoretically P(X<2) = ", p_le2_theory ));

iter_theory=k;
iter=mean(iter_vec)
print(paste0("The average number of iterations per sample is ", iter ));
print(paste0("  ... while theoretically it is k = ", iter_theory ));

hist(accept, probability = TRUE)
curve(x^2/9, from = 0, to = 3,add=TRUE)

```
